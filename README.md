# IMDb Movie Ratings Prediction
In this project, I built various regression models to predict ratings using a data frame consisting of movie-related features. I performed regression analysis using this dataset to predict movie ratings. The dataset provided a rich set of features related to movie attributes, cast, crew, and financials. I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and the target variable, ratings. 
I handled missing data and performed data preprocessing, including feature engineering and encoding categorical variables.To build the regression models, I employed techniques such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and lasso regression. I utilized appropriate evaluation metrics like mean squared error and R-squared to assess the performance of the models.
